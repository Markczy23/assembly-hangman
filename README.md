# 🪓 Assembly Hangman

**Assembly Hangman** is a twist on the classic Hangman game, built with **React**.  
Instead of a stick figure slowly meeting its doom, each wrong guess removes a programming language from the world — and once **Assembly** is the only one left standing, you’ve officially lost the game.


## 🎮 Overview

This project adds a playful developer-themed twist to the traditional guessing game.  
Players guess letters to uncover a hidden word, but with every mistake, a programming language is eliminated from the stack. Your goal: solve the word *before* Assembly becomes the last survivor.
